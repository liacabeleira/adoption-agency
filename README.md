# adoption-agency
#My final project for my programming course, in Java and MySQL
#This simulates a website for a possible adoption center, in which a potential adoptant browses through the available animals and sends an adoption request to the admin
#Duplicate requests for the same adoptant and same animal are not allowed
#The admin can approve or deny pending requests
#The admin can perform CRUD actions on animal list, and view adoptants list
